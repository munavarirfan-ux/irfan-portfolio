# Case study images

Put assets for each case study in a folder named by slug (e.g. `dropar`).

## DropAR (`/case-studies/dropar`)

| File | Used in |
|------|--------|
| `dropar/decision-1.png` … `decision-4.png` | Decisions & Impact blocks (4 images) |
| `dropar/phones-1a.png`, `phones-1b.png`, `phones-1c.png` | Hero device showcase (optional) |

Paths in the app are `/case-studies/dropar/<filename>` (e.g. `/case-studies/dropar/decision-1.png`).

If a file is missing, the page shows a placeholder and the label “Add image: public/case-studies/…”.
